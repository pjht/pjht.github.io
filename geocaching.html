Welcome to our geocaching page! This page will explain what geocaching is.

  Geocaching is a GPS treasure hunt.
  You use an app or a GPS receiver to navigate to within 10 feet of the geocache,
  and then you must find it yourself. There are hints for most geocaches, so if
  you can't find it, you gat get some help.
  Here is an explanation video from geocaching.com:
